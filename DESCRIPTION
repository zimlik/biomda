Description: The biomda package provides a systematic, data-driven approach to
    infer potential metabolite-disease associations by leveraging heterogeneous
    biomedical knowledge sources. This tool integrates multi-omics datasets,
    curated pathway databases, and literature-mined evidence to construct a
    probabilistic network for hypothesis generation.
